## Introduction
Gameship.com is a gaming website that will provide users with a platform to access game information and play games online. The website will be developed using React library for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end. The database used will be MongoDB cloud, which will store game and comment information.

## Features
The website will have two main sections:
**Game Presentation**: This section will provide users with information about various games. Users can view the gameâ€™s name, genre, platform, publisher, and release date. Additionally, users can view trailers and screenshots of the game, as well as read reviews and ratings from other users.
**Game Play and Comment Section**: This section will allow users to play games online and leave comments about them. Users can select a game to play, and the game will load in a separate window. After playing, users can leave comments and ratings about the game, which will be visible to other users.

## Technology
The website will be developed using the following technologies:
- Bootstrap                 *for css and js*
- React library		          *for the front-end development*
- Node.js and Express.js 	  *for the back-end development*

## Summary
Our project (Group 7) uses various modern technologies, including React, Express, JavaScript, Node.js, Public API, and MongoDB. GameShip website is a comprehensive single page application (SPA). The application enables users to read information from a Wiki page about games across the world, for example scores and stories. Moreover, users can play HTML5 games, some of which we've developed ourselves, on an arcade page. A membership system that allows registered users to comment on games and save their favorite games for personal collections is also part of the platform. The project is a demonstration of the capacity to work together and resolve issues, use theory knowledge for real world applications while developing basic skills in technology.
